# Procedure // Modify the procedure based on your circuit

Step 1: Set Up the Tinkercad Environment
1.	Log in to Tinkercad: Open Tinkercad in your web browser and log in to your account.
2.	Create a New Circuit: In the Tinkercad dashboard, click on "Circuits" and then select "Create New Circuit."
Step 2: Add Components to the Circuit
1.	Arduino Uno: Drag an Arduino Uno board from the components panel onto the workspace.
2.	TMP36 Sensor: Search for the TMP36 sensor in the components panel and drag it into the workspace.
3.	Breadboard: Drag a small breadboard to the workspace to help with wiring connections.
4.	Resistor (Optional): A resistor may not be necessary for this simple setup, but you can include it for more accurate readings.
5.	Wires: Use wires to connect the components.

Step 3: Connect the TMP36 Sensor to the Arduino
1.	TMP36 Pins:
o	Vout (Middle Pin): Connect this to an analog input pin on the Arduino (e.g., A0).
o	GND (Right Pin): Connect this pin to the ground (GND) on the Arduino.
o	Vs (Left Pin): Connect this to the 5V pin on the Arduino.
2.	Breadboard Wiring:
o	TMP36 Vout (Middle Pin) to Arduino A0: Use a wire to connect the middle pin (Vout) of the TMP36 sensor to the A0 analog input pin on the Arduino.
o	TMP36 GND (Right Pin) to Breadboard GND Rail: Connect the GND pin of the TMP36 sensor to the ground rail of the breadboard.
o	TMP36 Vs (Left Pin) to Breadboard 5V Rail: Connect the Vs pin of the TMP36 sensor to the 5V rail of the breadboard.
o	Arduino GND to Breadboard GND Rail: Connect a wire from the Arduino GND pin to the ground rail on the breadboard.
o	Arduino 5V to Breadboard 5V Rail: Connect a wire from the Arduino 5V pin to the power rail on the breadboard.
Step 4: Write the Arduino Code
1.	Code Editor: Click on the "Code" button at the top of the Tinkercad workspace to open the code editor.
2.	Set the Coding Mode: Ensure the editor is in "Text" mode to write your code in C/C++.
3.	Enter the Code: Write the following code to read the temperature from the TMP36 sensor
Step 5: Simulate the Circuit
1.	Start Simulation: Click the "Start Simulation" button at the top of the workspace to run the circuit and code.
2.	Monitor Output: Open the serial monitor by clicking the "Serial Monitor" button to view the temperature readings in both Celsius and Fahrenheit.
Step 6: Troubleshoot and Refine
1.	Check Connections: Ensure that all connections are made correctly on the breadboard and the Arduino.
2.	Adjust Code: If needed, tweak the code to improve accuracy or change the format of the output.
Step 7: Save Your Work
1.	Stop Simulation: Click "Stop Simulation" to end the simulation.
2.	Save the Circuit: Click "Save" to keep your circuit design and code for future use.


# Program
```
const int analogIn = A0;
int humiditysensorOutput = 0;
// Defining Variables
int RawValue= 0;
double Voltage = 0;
double tempC = 0;
double tempF = 0;
void setup(){  
  Serial.begin(9600);
  pinMode(A1, INPUT);
}
void loop(){
  RawValue = analogRead(analogIn);
  Voltage = (RawValue / 1023.0) * 5000; // 5000 to get millivots.
  tempC = (Voltage-500) * 0.1; // 500 is the offset
  tempF = (tempC * 1.8) + 32; // convert to F  
  Serial.print("Raw Value = " );                  
  Serial.print(RawValue);      
  Serial.print("\t milli volts = ");
  Serial.print(Voltage,0); //
  Serial.print("\t Temperature in C = ");
  Serial.print(tempC,1);
  Serial.print("\t Temperature in F = ");
  Serial.println(tempF,1);
  humiditysensorOutput = analogRead(A1);
  Serial.print("Humidity: "); // Printing out Humidity Percentage
  Serial.print(map(humiditysensorOutput, 0, 1023, 10, 70));
  Serial.println("%");
  delay(5000);  //iterate every 5 seconds
}
```
# Result
The temperature and humidity values are measured using DHT11/DHT22/TMP36 sensor with Arduino UNO Board/ESP-32 and Simulated using Tinker CAD.
